Selenium-js-video-recorder
==========================

This is an easy way to get video recordings of your javascript selenium testcases.


This library binds to a couple of webdriver hooks to take screenshots after each command has executed,
then uses `ffmpeg` to stitch these together to one mp4-movie per test case.

It uses docker to run ffmpeg for multi-platform support

Pros:
- Nice videos in your allure reports. Yey.
- Works with selenium grid
- Works with all webdrivers that support saveScreenshot

Cons:
- Makes the tests a bit slower


Be sure to take a look at `demo/wdio.conf.js` to see how to get started.
